This section covers the necessary steps to get the frontend of the Progress app up and running on your local development machine, including setup, installation, dependencies, testing, building, and deployment.

### 🏃 Quickstart

To get started quickly with the frontend of the Progress app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. `git clone https://github.com/ParsaKargari/Progress.git`.
2. Navigate to the project's frontend directory. `cd ./frontend/` from the root directory of the project.
3. Run `npm install --force` to install all the required dependencies.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running `npm start`.

### 🛠️ Dependencies & Packages

The Progress frontend is built using React and utilizes several additional libraries and frameworks to enhance its functionality and design. Here's a list of the key dependencies:

- #### UI Frameworks & Design

  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
  - [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/): A popular React UI framework that provides a set of components and styles for building modern web applications.

- #### Date Handling

- #### Other Utilities

  - [react-heat-map](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uiw/react-heat-map): A React component for rendering heatmaps.

### 🧪 Testing

The frontend of the Progress app is tested using the Jest and React Testing Library. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### 🚀 Building & Deployment

To build the frontend of the Progress app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the frontend in the `./build` directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting service of your choice.

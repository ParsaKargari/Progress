| `422` | `Unprocessable entity`  | Whenever there is something wrong with the request (e.g. missing parameters, validation errors) even though the syntax is correct (i.e., `400` is not warranted). |
| `500` | `Internal server error` | When an internal error has happened (e.g. when trying to add/update records in the database fails).                                                               |
